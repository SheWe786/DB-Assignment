## Relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" Entities

### Nature of Relationship

The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is one of association. This association allows each product to be categorized into one specific product category, facilitating the organization and classification of products based on shared characteristics or attributes.

### One-to-Many Relationship

Typically, a one-to-many relationship exists between "Product_Category" and "Product." This signifies that each product category can have multiple products associated with it, while each product can belong to only one category at a time.

## Ensuring Valid Categories for Products

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, the following strategies can be employed:

1. **Foreign Key Constraints:**
   Utilize foreign key constraints in the database schema. Define a foreign key relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" tables to enforce referential integrity. This ensures that every value in the `category_id` column of the "Product" table corresponds to a valid primary key value in the `category_id` column of the "Product_Category" table.

2. **Application-Level Data Validation:**
   Implement data validation rules within the application logic. Prior to inserting or updating a product record in the "Product" table, validate that the associated category exists in the "Product_Category" table. If the category does not exist, prevent the operation or prompt the user to select a valid category.

These measures collectively contribute to maintaining data consistency and accuracy within the relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category."
